# DSLs-Made-Easy-code

Repo of all code from my book Domain-Specific Languages Made Easy, for the purposes of sharing pre-publication.


## Notes

* `package.json`/`version` is now of the form `0.n.0-dev`, with `n` = currently-published MEAP-version + 1.


## TODOs

* Update all chapters w.r.t. book.
* &#10003; Add(/update) `README.md` per chapter, also with CLI commands.
* Configure all NPM deps.
