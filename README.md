# Business-Friendly-DSLs-code

All the code from the book [“Business-Friendly DSLs”](https://www.manning.com/books/business-friendly-dsls) ([liveBook](https://livebook.manning.com/book/business-friendly-dsls/)) by Meinte Boersma for Manning Publications.


## Installation instructions

Running the code requires a recent version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and an NPM-compatible package manager, so either NPM itself or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).
For more details: see appendix A of the book.


## Running the code

This repository contains the code developed in the course of chapters 3-15 and appendix B of the book, with one directory per chapter/appendix.
(Chapter 2 contains a static mockup of DSL content.)
Each directory contains a README detailing how to run the code.


## Notes

* Please report issues preferably through the [liveBook](https://livebook.manning.com/book/business-friendly-dsls/), or otherwise through the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/dslmeinte/Business-Friendly-DSLs-code/issues). 
* Because the code is taken from the book, there's virtually no possibility to accept feature requests or Pull Requests.
* `package.json`/`version` is of the form `0.n.0-dev`, with `n` = currently-published MEAP-version + 1.
